# Udacity-Projects
A collection of the Projects that I had to complete to graduate it's "Intro to programming" nanodegree
For the Animal Trading Card I had to create a Web-Page which represented a trading card of my favorite animal. I then had to style the page so it would have the same structure as the example Page. I had to use CSS and HTML for this project.
For the second project, RPS or RockPaperScissors, I had to create a Rock Paper Scissors game with Python. There should be options to say how many rounds that you want to play, who your opponent will be (how he will play) and it should keep track of the score.
For the third and last project I had to create a Pixel Art Maker. The goal was that the user could create a grid with a height of y and a width of x cells. Then the user could pick a color and color one field at the time in this specific color. I had to use a bit of HTML, CSS and mainly JavaScript.
